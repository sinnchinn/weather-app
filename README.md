// more self notes: assignment was really hard for me, referenced old code but i didn't do it correctly the first time so nothing was working. didn't get favorites to work or mobile responsiveness because assignment is already late. will work on it when i have the time. all i really need is the local storage.

// peer review comments: Your website looks really good! The Favorites section is entirely broken, but that's the only negative I see. Your Ui is cozy looking, and the search function works as it should. Overall great job!!
